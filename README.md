Create an inheritance hierarchy of Rodent: Mouse, Gerbil, Hamster, etc. In the base class, provide methods that are common to all Rodents, and refine these in the derived classes to perform different behaviours depending on the specific type of Rodent. Rodent must be created as a pure abstract base class. Create an array of pointers (10) to Rodent, and fill it with different specific types of Rodents. Call your base class methods, and display the results.
